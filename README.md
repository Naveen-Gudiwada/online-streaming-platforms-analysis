# 🎬 Python Dataset Analysis - Online Streaming Platforms

This project performs data analysis and visualization on datasets from major online streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon Prime. The objective is to explore the trends in content distribution, analyze ratings, genres, and release years, and perform a comparative study between these platforms to derive insights about the entertainment industry.

## 📄 Project Files
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing all the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.
- **datasets/**: Folder containing CSV files from Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon Prime. Each file contains data about movies and TV shows available on the respective streaming platforms.
- **documentation/NaveenProject.docx**: Complete internship project documentation that explains the methodology, data cleaning steps, and analysis in detail.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (3.x)
- NumPy (1.21.0)
- Pandas (1.3.0)
- Matplotlib (3.4.2)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and displaying the analysis)

## 📈 Project Highlights
- **Dataset Preprocessing and Cleaning**: 
  - Handled missing data and cleaned datasets for consistency across platforms.
  - Converted categorical data to numerical data for easier analysis.
  
- **Visualization of Content Distribution**: 
  - Visualized the distribution of movies and TV shows across genres, platforms, and other relevant categories.
  
- **Analysis of Release Years, Ratings, and Genres**: 
  - Analyzed trends in release years and ratings of movies and TV shows.
  - Identified genre preferences on each platform.
  
- **Comparative Study Between Different Streaming Platforms**: 
  - Compared content availability, genres, ratings, and other attributes between Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon Prime.

## 📂 Dataset Sources
Public datasets for Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon Prime are provided in the `datasets/` directory. These datasets contain information on movies, TV shows, release years, ratings, genres, and other metadata.

## 🤝 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to my department and project supervisors at ANITS for their continuous support and guidance throughout the course of this project.

Thanks to the open-source community for the datasets and resources that made this analysis possible.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Add more data sources for other streaming platforms like HBO Max and Apple TV+.

Incorporate machine learning models to predict content ratings based on genre, release year, etc.

Implement more interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Dash.
